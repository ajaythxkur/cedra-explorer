# Cedra Explorer

Cedra Explorer is a community-focused blockchain explorer built for the Cedra network. While every blockchain has an explorer, many prioritize functionality over usability. Cedra Explorer takes a **UX-first approach**, delivering a clean, modern, and intuitive interface that makes exploring on-chain data simple and visually appealing for everyone.

The explorer provides transparent access to the Cedra blockchain by transforming complex on-chain data into an easy-to-understand experience. It helps users track transactions, explore blocks in real time, and monitor key network statistics, while also serving as a reliable tool for developers building on Cedra.
